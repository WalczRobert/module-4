You are online shopping at SuperAwesomeCouponDealsAndStuff.com. They offer two types of discounts. The first is cash-off coupons, that you earn by shoppings. You may apply one $5 or $10 cash off per order. The second is percent discount coupons for 10%, 15%, or 20% off. If you have cash-off coupons, those must be applied first, then apply the percent discount coupons on the pre-tax amount. Then you add tax at 6% and shipping according to these guidelines:

up to $10 dollars, shipping is $5.95
$10 and up to $30 dollars, shipping is $7.95
$30 and up to $50 dollars, shipping is $11.95
Shipping is free for $50 and over
In this program, you will write a a function accept the amount of the purchase, the cash coupon, the percent coupon and it will calculate and return the total order item.

For instance, you have $5 off and 30% coupons and your item is $15.99, you will first take

$15.99 - $5.00 = $10.99.
30% off $10.99 to get $7.69
Add tax at 6% to get $8.15
Add shipping cost before tax $5.95 to get $14.10
Write a function calculate_order(price, cash_coupon, percent_coupon) that first returns pass
